Quickly access your beloved Pi-hole from GNOME Shell.

Phi provides the following features:
- Monitor single or multiple Pi-hole instances,
- Enable/disable blocking,
- Display status and main statistics,
- Show version information of Pi-hole, and notify when there is an update.

You can also configure Phi to look for Pi-hole only in a certain network. This might be useful if your computer connects to school, work or public Wi-Fi.
